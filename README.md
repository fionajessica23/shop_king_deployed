### Approach

Shop King is a lite online shopping App that I built using React. It emulates shopping process done online where user/customer can select the products they wish to buy and also receive discount with a valid voucher code.

In building this App, I started with one main class that contains all the components with some objects data that are held in an array. As the functionality of the App grows and have more components, I abstracted some of the components to some separate stateless functions while the main class still holding all the states.

After finished building the App, instead of using the provided objects data in the main class, I made my own api where I can fetch my data from.
